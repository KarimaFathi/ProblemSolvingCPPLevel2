## Exercise 5: Reverse Digits of a Number

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that reads a positive number from the user and prints its digits in reverse order. The program should prompt the user to input a number, and then print each digit of the number starting from the least significant (rightmost) digit to the most significant (leftmost) digit.

### Approach

There are two approaches to reversing the digits of a number:

1- the first method converts the integer to a string, allowing easy access to each digit in reverse order by iterating over the string from last to first.

2- The second method uses mathematical operations, repeatedly dividing the number by 10 to extract each digit via modulus,

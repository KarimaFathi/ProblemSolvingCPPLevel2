# Problem Solving in C++ - Level 2

Welcome to my C++ problem-solving repository! In this repository, I solve various algorithmic problems to enhance my programming skills in C++. Each problem is stored in its own directory, and this README will describe each of the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Multiplication Table Generator (1 to 10)

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that generates and displays a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10 in a well-formatted manner. The table should display the multiplication of each number from 1 to 10 with every other number in the range.

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the multiplication table generated by the program:

# Problem Solving in C++ - Level 2

Welcome to my C++ problem-solving repository! In this repository, I solve various algorithmic problems to enhance my programming skills in C++. Each problem is stored in its own directory, and this README will describe each of the exercises.

## Exercise 1: Multiplication Table Generator (1 to 10)

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that generates and displays a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 10 in a well-formatted manner. The table should display the multiplication of each number from 1 to 10 with every other number in the range.

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the multiplication table generated by the program:

## Exercise 2: Prime Numbers from 1 to N

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that generates and prints all prime numbers in the range from 1 to a user-specified number N.

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the program:

## Exercise 3: Perfect Number Checker

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that checks whether a given number is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, 3) sum up to 6.

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the program:

## Exercise 4: Perfect Numbers from 1 to N

### Problem Statement:

The task is to create a program that generates and prints all perfect numbers in the range from 1 to a user-specified number N.

### Output:

Below is an example of the output of the program:
